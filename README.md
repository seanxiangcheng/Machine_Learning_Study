This repository stores my codes for learning of machine learning. 
Most codes are implementation or application of certain methods/algorithm.
Most code are not well-documented because the learning process is also a code-changing process. 
Didn't quite catch up with the documentation.

If you are interested in the methods used there, 
feel free to contact me: chengxiang.cn@gmail.com.
I am glad to discuss these methods, to offer help if I can, and to collaborate on interesting projects.

Thanks!
